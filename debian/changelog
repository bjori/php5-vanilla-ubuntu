  * Unapply patches with debian/rules clean

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Don't patch configure or php_config.h.in in suhosin.patch, as these are
    auto-generated and including them in the patch results in a race
    condition for the necessary build-time regeneration.  Thanks to Daniel
    Schepler for reporting, and to Damyan Ivanov for helping to sort out the
    fix.  Closes: #443637.
  * Also remove the modified auto-generated files in the clean target,
    which triggers a warning about disappearing files when building the
    source package but avoids carrying irrelevant diffs to these files
    in the Debian diff.
  * Now that the testsuite is being run at build time, test failures cause
    a bunch of junk files to be left around in the Debian diff.  So clean up
    several false-positive failures:
    - 052-phpinfo_no_configure.patch: we're patching the output of phpinfo(),
      so patch the test as well
    - fix_broken_upstream_tests.patch: use a local directory for tests that
      use sessions, skip the phpinfo test after all because it doesn't appear
      to be compatible with current testsuite behavior, and disable the
      moneyformat test if en_US locale is not available.
    There are still several other failing tests, but these are not false
    positives and remain enabled pending investigation.

  * New upstream release.
  * Security issues resolved in the latest release:
    - CVE-2007-2519 - Directory traversal vulnerability in PEAR
  

  [ sean finney ]
  * patch from Jan Wagner to be able to conditionally disable any
    patches that break binary-compatibility with official php
    binary-only extensions.  see debian/rules for more information.
  * now incorporate the php unit tests into the build process.  for
    those interested the output is stored in the file
    /usr/share/doc/php5-common/test-results.txt .
  * by default we now ship with enable_dl = Off, as there are some
    fairly significant ramifications security-wise to having it on.
  * we shipping with the suhosin patch enabled by default.
    special thanks to Blars Blarson for providing a sparc machine for
    testing purposes with 5.2.3 (closes: #397179).
  * new binary package php5-gmp, with the newly enabled gmp extension,
    since whatever reason for not doing so either never existed or no
    no longer exists (closes: #344137).  Build-Depends added for libgmp3-dev.

  * php5-module.postinst: don't assume that the postinst is only relevant
    when called with 'configure' as an argument, some future debhelper code
    could apply in the case of other methods of invocation.
  * Clean up build dependencies for recent library transitions:
    - libsnmp-dev is now the real package name, and is supported as a virtual
      package for backports.
    - re-add firebird2-dev as an alternative to firebird1.5-dev, to support
      backports.
    - the curl -dev package name has changed from libcurl3-openssl-dev to
      libcurl4-openssl-dev; update to the proper name, with libcurl-dev as
      an alternative.
  * Switch php5-sybase to use the mssql extension instead of the sybase_ct
    extension.  Closes: #418734, #329065.

    no need for the php5-json package.  added a Provides/Conflicts to
    help set an upgrade path.
  - apache 1.x support is soon disappearing.  as a consequence we are
    no longer building the libapache-mod-php5 module.  the php5 metapackage

php5 (5.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release, skipping the problematic 5.1.0 release:
    - Fixes a zend.ze1_compatibility_mode segfault (closes: #333374)
    - Remove libtool patch from acinclude.m4, now integrated upstream.
    - Remove 038-round_test_fix.patch, now integrated upstream.
    - Remove 049-exported-headers.patch, as upstream's build system has
      gotten more clever about what they should and shouldn't export.
    - Remove 054-open_basedir_slash.patch, now integrated upstream.
    - Remove 055-gd_safe_mode_checks.patch, fixed differently upstream.
    - Mangle 101-sqlite_is_shared.patch, to deal with upstream changes.
    - Remove 104-64_bit_serialize.patch, now integrated upstream.
    - Remove 105-64_bit_imagettftext.patch, now integrated upstream.
  * Many security vulnerabilities fixed (closes: #341368, #336005, #336654):
    - Resolves a local denial of service in the apache2 SAPI, which can
      be triggered by using session.save_path in .htaccess; CVE-2005-3319
    - Resolves an infinite loop in the exif_read_data function which can
      be triggered with a specially-crafted JPEG image; CVE-2005-3353
    - Resolves a vulnerability in the parse_str function whereby a remote
      attacker can fool PHP into turning on register_globals, thus making
      applications vulnerable to global variable injections; CVE-2005-3389
    - Resolves a vulnerability in the RFC1867 file upload feature where, if
      register_globals is enabled, a remote attacker can modify the GLOBALS
      array with a multipart/form-data POST request; see CVE-2005-3390
    - Resolves numerous safe_mode and open_basedir bypasses; CVE-2005-3391
    - Resolves INI settings leaks in the apache2 SAPI, leading to safe_mode
      and open_basedir bypasses between virtual hosts; CVE-2005-3392 
    - Resolves a CRLF injection vulnerability in the mb_send_mail function,
      allowing injection of arbitrary mail headers; see CVE-2005-3883
    - Includes PEAR 1.4.5, resolving a vulnerability in the pear installer
      which could lead to arbitrary code execution; see CVE-2005-4154
  * Bump libdb build-dep from libdb4.2 to libdb4.3, to match with apache.
  * Bump our MySQL build-dep to 5.0's libmysqlclient15-dev (closes: #343793)
  * Automate the process of getting the list of built-in modules into the
    package descriptions, so it stays fresh in the future (closes: #341867)
  * Intentionally disable PDO support until I've sorted out the best way to
    deal with shipping this shiny new feature that won't break the world.
  * The new PEAR happens to fix the Command.php greedy match bug filed in
    Debian as part of the fix for the wider security issue (closes: #334969)
  * Create 056-mime_magic_strings.patch, making the mime_magic extension
    more liberal about what mime-types is accepts, as well as making it skip
    over ones it dislikes, rather than disabling itself (closes: #335674)
  * Add 057-no_apache_installed.patch, to stop spewing a mess of errors in
    configure because we don't have the apache binaries in the build chroot.
  * Fix small typo in the php5-xsl package description (closes: #344816)

php5 (5.0.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depend on libcurl3-openssl-dev, since libcurl3-dev is going away
    soon.  Keep libcurl3-dev as an alternate for backporting (see: #334367)
  * Switch from libmysqlclient12 to libmysqlclient14; this puts us on the
    *other* side of the line regarding which combinations of DSOs cause
    segfaults, so hopefully the others catch up with us soon (closes: #332453)
  * Look for magic.mime in /usr/share/file now instead of /usr/share/misc/file,
    as the path has been changed to comply with the FHS (see: #334510)
  * Make the above backportable as well, by searching for both files, and
    picking the one that's currently installed on the user's system.
  * Include swedish debconf translation from Daniel Nylander (closes: #330763)
  * Make pear use '/usr/bin/php' instead of just 'php' to make sure we don't
    get some random binary on $PATH that won't work right (closes: #329415)
  * Set PHP_PEAR_SIG_BIN to /usr/bin/gpg, and have php-pear Recommends: gnupg

php5 (5.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove Andres Salomon from the Uploaders field, at his request.  Thanks
    for all your work on the PHP packages, Andres, now fix our kernel bugs.
  * Add 054-open_basedir_slash.patch, which fixes a bug where if open_basedir
    is set to "/foo/", users can access files in "/foobar/", which is not the
    documented behaviour; this addresses CAN-2005-3054 (see: #323585)
  * Add 104-64_bit_serialize.patch from Joe Orton, resolving a segfault when
    serializing objects on all 64-bit architectures (closes: #329768)
  * Add 105-64_bit_imagettftext.patch, fixing a type mismatch in the GD
    extension, causing memory corruption on 64-bit arches (closes: #331001)
  * Add 055-gd_safe_mode_checks.patch from PHP CVS, adding missing safe_mode
    checks to the _php_image_output and _php_image_output_ctx GD functions.
  * Make php-pear Provide, Replace, and Conflict php-html-template-it, which
    we appear to have absorbed into the main PEAR packaging (closes: #332393)

    - Drop 009-snmp-int-sizes.patch, finally fixed upstream.
    - Drop 051-gcc-4.0.patch, fixed differently upstream.
    - Drop 102-php_streams.patch, fixed upstream.
    - Drop 103-catch_segv.patch, also fixed upstream.
    - Includes PEAR XML_RPC fix for CAN-2005-2498.
    - Includes phpinfo() XSS fix for CVE-2005-3388.
  * Distribute the shiny new manpages for php-config and phpize.

php5 (5.0.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ondřej Surý <ondrej@sury.org>:
    - Add patch from CVS to fix regression in PHP 5.0.4, where file related
      functions all stop reading at 2,000,000 bytes (closes: #321930)
  * Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>:
    - Enable support for gdbm files in the dba handler; half the base system
      already appears to depend on libgdm, so we can't make things worse.
    - Add another patch from CVS to fix a segfault in the catch/throw
      handler under interesting nesting cases (closes: #322507)  
    - Rebuild against libsnmp9-dev for new libsnmp SOVER (closes: #327107)

php5 (5.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * And fix the module/extension API situation one last time, this time
    we read ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO, ZEND_MODULE_API_NO, and PHP_API_VERSION,
    pick the most recent of the three, assume things broke in ways we're
    not willing to cope with, and both change the extension directory to
    use that value, as well as setting it to the provides/depends for the
    various SAPI and extension packages.
  * Add a new option to php-config, 'php-config --phpapi', which extension
    packagers should now be using to get the current phpapi they're building
    against and set their dependencies accordingly.
  * Strip the -gnu off the end of the DEB_*_* variables and drop the
    versioned dpkg-dev build-dep to ease backporting to sarge and hoary;
    doing so in such a way as to still allow for easy cross-compiling.
  * Add postgresql-dev build-dep alternate for easy hoary/sarge backports.
  * Make libapache2-mod-php5 the default alternate dependency for the php5
    metapackage, since we really do want to encourage the apache upgrade. 
  * Make php5-dev stop shipping copies of files from autotools-dev, shtool,
    and libtool, and instead symlink to them and depend on those packages,
    thus avoiding the shtool issues from CAN-2005-1751 and CAN-2005-1759.

  * We now have a mailing list.  Set the maintainer to the list, and move
    myself to Uploaders where, apparently, I belong.
  * Use ZEND_MODULE_API_NO rather than PHP_API_VERSION for extension deps,
    as recent upstream ABI breakage in 4.4.0 leads me to believe this is
    the only constant they actually bother to update on ABI changes.
  * Bring back some concflicts that went missing (libapache-mod-php5 needs
    to conflict with libapache-mod-php4 and older versions of php4, while
    the two libapache2-mod-php[45] modules also need to conflict).
  * Adjust debian/watch to not match on upstream's alpha/beta/rc releases.

php5 (5.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial PHP5 release; packaging forked from php4 4:4.3.11-1.
    - Closes: #262977, #293832 
  * Ondrej Sury <ondrej@sury.org>:
    - Removed some obsolete cruft, since there wasn't any previous php5
      packages there is no need, to check /usr/share/doc/*, etc.
    - Removed apache2 IfModule hack, it's been fixed in php5.
    - Updated patches to php5, removing those which are obsolete.
    - Changes xslt extension to xsl (using libxslt).
    - Updated debian/* including changelog.
    - Raised update-alternatives priority to 50.
  * Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>:
    - Merged with php4 4:4.4.0-1 packaging.
    - Re-roll upstream tarball to include PEAR::XML_RPC 1.3.3, which
      includes a security fix for CVE CAN-2005-1921.
    - Bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2, with no source changes.
    - Stop distributing the phpextdist binary, as upstream has stopped.
    - Drop the ext_skel binary and skeleton dir from php5-dev, as it has
      been deemed obsolete upstream and the version in the tarball is not
      considered useful anymore.  PEAR::PECL_Gen upstream will replace it.
    - Fix longstanding broken shebang lines in debconf config scripts.
    - Remove lintian overrides for modules; lintian no longer complains
      about missing shlibs for libraries outside the linker path.
    - Add a linda override for the non-standard directory permissions on
      /var/lib/php5 in php5-common.
    - Rename php5-pear to php-pear, have it replace php4-pear, and depend
      on php5-cli OR php4-cli; make sure it works with both.
    - Compile in SOAP extension (closes: #307580)
    - Enable SQLite extension as shared, make the xmlrpc extension shared.
    - Enabled the pgsql extension, and disabled the imap extension (which
      will be moving to another source package and become the example
      package for out-of-tree builds).

php4 (4:4.3.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #304052)
    - Drop CVS patches, we're back in step with upstream versions.
    - Remove 048-x509_multiple_orgUnits.patch, incorporated in 4.3.11.
    - Remove 050-4.3.11_file_copy_fix.patch, incorporated in 4.3.11.
    - Remove 040-curl_open_basedir.patch, as upstream has solved this
      in a different fashion.
    - Adjust patches for offset and fuzz.
    - Remove bits from debian/rules dealing with the DB PEAR extension,
      since it's no longer shipped in the php4-pear package.
  * Rebuild against newer version of freetds library (closes: #317369)
  * Add 052-phpinfo_no_configure.patch, which disables the display of our
    "Configure Command" in phpinfo(), which was the source of many bogus
    bug reports over the years, due to people misinterpreting its meaning.
  * New translations to Vietnamese and Russian (closes: #316821, #310199)
    - vi.po contributed by Clytie Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>
    - ru.po contributed by Yuriy Talakan' <yt@amur.elektra.ru>
  * Mention FastCGI in the description of php4-cgi (closes: #310810)

  * Bring back the shipping of /usr/share/doc symlinks in our packages,
    as this, in concert with moving the migration detection from preinst
    to postinst (which was done in the last upload), seems to give us the
    sanest upgrade path.  Thanks to Steve Langasek for smacking me around
    with unpack/upgrade scenarios for a while to convince me of this.

php4 (4:4.3.10-14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Revert the directory->symlink magic to work how it used to, since the
    new behaviour broke hideously on upgrades from Woody, causing certain
    files (like the changelog) to mysteriously go missing (closes: #307591)
  * Move our template php.ini to /usr/share/php4, so we stop violating
    policy by using files from /usr/share/doc (as seen in #307591)
  * Remove 'readline' from the php4-cli package description, since we don't
    actually build with readline support enabled anymore (closes: #306571)

php4 (4:4.3.10-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 050-4.3.11_file_copy_fix.patch, which reverts a broken 'fix'
    made to the copy() function, causing it to fail in particularly
    spectacular ways when used on remote files (closes: #304601)
  * Use -g instead of -gstabs on powerpc64-linux (closes: #301571)

php4 (4:4.3.10-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Address an FTBFS waiting to happen in the php4-dev package:
    - Remove Win32 and Netware specific headers.
    - Stop shipping php4-pgsql headers.
    - Stop shipping the expat headers, since we don't even
      use the bundled expat library.
    - Make php4-dev depend on libssl-dev, since it wants to include
      ssl.h when you use it to build network-using extensions.
  * Stop building extensions twice; we don't need two copies.

php4 (4:4.3.10-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to 200503131325 CVS (AKA: 4.3.11RC1), fixing several bugs
    including a segfault in mysql_fetch_field() (closes: #299608)
  * Remove 042-remove_windows_paths.patch, incorporated upstream.
  * Add 048-x509_multiple_orgUnits.patch to bring the openssl extension
    in line with the upcoming 4.3.11 behaviour of listing multiple
    Organisational Units in an x509 cert as an array, rather than only
    listing the last in the list.
  * After much talk with upstream, revert the ZTS changes.  We are no
    longer building a thread-safe PHP. (closes: #299820, #297223, #297679)
  * ZTS was breaking file search paths, leading to errors loading files
    from the cwd (closes: #298282, #298518, #299089, #299356)
  * Stop building caudium-php4 (closes: #294718, #297702, #295100)
    - We can't link against the GPL pike7.2, which we've been doing.  Oops.
    - Even if the above weren't true, upstream has insisted that ZTS is a
      horribly broken solution, slated for eventual removal, and should
      never, ever be used.  In light of that, caudium users should instead
      use php4-cgi, either as a plain CGI, or as a FastCGI backend.
    - Not even attempting to provide an upgrade path, as it would be
      needlessly complex, and caudium-php4 in previous stable releases
      was nothing more than a useless toy, given that it had nearly no
      useful extensions built-in or supported.
  * Rewrite 041-shut_up_snmp.patch to take a different approach, this time
    regrettably reverting a fix for a memory leak, in the name of making
    things work properly, including squashing the putenv() intecaction
    bug between PHP and other apache modules (closes: #298511, #300628)
  * On sidegrades from distributions where different modules may be built
    from their own source, and thus have their own doc directories, bad
    things happen when we try to replace those with symlinks, so now we
    check for this in preinst, and fix stuff up magically to Just Work.
  * Add Jeroen van Wolffelaar <jeroen@wolffelaar.nl> to Uploaders.
  * Fix up modules regexes to use "\.so" instead of ".so" (cf: #300998)

    dl() function in our builds, despite upstream's claim that it "might
    not be threadsafe on all platforms"; it is on ours (closes: #297839)

    seem to not have been hurting us terribly so far, while the "fix"
    (breaking persistent lists) was, uhm, bad (closes: #295998, #296694)
  * Revise 041-shut_up_snmp.patch to call init_snmp with 'snmpapp' as the
    appname, rather than 'php', to maintain backward compatibility, and to
    wrap our setenv/unsetenv magic only around snmp_shutdown, which seems to
    solve a segfault when php4-snmp is loaded with mod_perl (closes: #296282)
  * Fix 042-remove_windows_paths.patch to catch both cases where windows
    path stripping should occur (closes: #296406)

  * Fix up caudium description to reflect the fact that caudium it is no

php4 (4:4.3.10-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update to CVS, as of 200502060530 (closes: #288672)
    - Fixes two vulnerabilities in exif.c, CAN-2005-1042 and CAN-2005-1043
    - Fixes two vulnerabilities in image.c, CAN-2005-0524 and CAN-2005-0525
    - File uploads with "'" in them aren't cut off anymore (closes: #288679)
    - unserialize() is no longer ridiculously slow (closes: #291392)
    - Add 000-200502060530_CVS.patch
    - Adapt debian/rules to the realities of upstream's new buildconf
    - Add 033-we_WANT_libtool.patch, to force relibtoolizing with Debian's
      libtool, rather than using upstream's broken bundled libtool
    - Drop 031_zend_strtod_1.1.2.10.patch and 032_zend_strtod_debian.patch
    - Adjust patches for offsets and fuzz
    - Force --with-pic, as policy demands it, and the build system doesn't
  * Added several patches, yanked from the Fedora PHP sources:
    - 034-apache2_umask_fix.patch, fixes umask not being properly reset
      after each request (closes: #286225)
    - 036-fd_setsize_fix.patch, fixes misuse of FD_SET()
    - 038-round_test_fix.patch, makes the rounding test work on gcc-3.3
  * Removed --with-libedit, as being able to background php is more useful,
    in my opinion, than using readline functions (see #286356)
  * Include zip support in all SAPIs (closes: #288534, #288909)
  * Enable Zend Thread Safety for all SAPIs, meaning that our modules
    are now compiled for ZTS APIs as well.  (closes: #278212, #264015)
    - Make sure caudium-php4 now provides phpapi-$(ver), and modules can
      be configured with the caudium SAPI.
    - Add 039-reentrant_libs.patch to link to the reentrant versions of
      libldap and libmysqlclient
  * Stop suggesting phpdoc, as it's undistributable anyway.
  * Add 040-curl_open_basedir.patch, to make php4-curl respect the value
    of open_basedir, thanks to Martin Pitt (closes: #291410)

    failing) to write persistent data every time it shuts down.  Ugh.

php4 (4:4.3.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, including the following security fixes:
    - CAN-2004-1018 - shmop_write() out of bounds memory write access.
    - CAN-2004-1018 - integer overflow/underflow in pack() and unpack()
      functions.
    - CAN-2004-1019 - possible information disclosure, double free and
      negative reference index array underflow in deserialization code.
    - CAN-2004-1020 - addslashes() not escaping \0 correctly.
    - CAN-2004-1063 - safe_mode execution directory bypass.
    - CAN-2004-1064 - arbitrary file access through path truncation.
    - CAN-2004-1065 - exif_read_data() overflow on long sectionname.
    - magic_quotes_gpc could lead to one level directory traversal with
      file uploads.
  * Adjust patch offsets for new upstream, fix 013-force_getaddrinfo.patch
    to match with new configure.in and drop 026-4.3.10_session_fixes.patch

php4 (4:4.3.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>:
    - Add -fno-strict-aliasing to CFLAGS, as the (several thousand)
      warnings I'm getting from GCC are frightening me a tad.
    - Remove the php-cgi alternative in php4-cgi's prerm, to avoid
      leaving dangling symlinks (closes: #275962, #282315)
    - Include 030-imap_getacl.patch, adding the imap_getacl() function
      required by the GOsa project (closes: #282484)
    - Include php.ini-paranoid in doc/examples, provided and maintained
      by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña (closes: #274374)
    - Make /cgi-bin/php4 an alternative for /cgi-bin/php (closes: #282464)
    - Remove obsolete info from README.Debian relating to session_mm,
      since we stopped building with libmm a while back.
    - Reintroduce /usr/lib/php4/libexec that went missing in a previous
      upload, since the build uses it as the default safe_mode exec dir.
  * Andres Salomon <dilinger@voxel.net>:
    - Add patch to include gd headers in php4-dev, as some PECL modules
      (notably, pdflib) expect it; 028-export_gd_headers.patch.
    - Lintian fix: Add missing #DEBHELPER# token to php4-common.postrm.

php4 (4:4.3.9-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, removed the following patches fixed upstream:
    014-apache2handler_CVS_fixes.patch, 015-gdNewDynamicCtx_Add_Ex.patch,
    018-unix_socket_fd_leak.patch, 020-4.3.9_overflow_fixes.patch,
    021-4.3.9_sybase_ct_fixes.patch, 022-4.3.9_sprintf_fixes.patch,
    023-4.3.9_array_fixes.patch, 024-4.3.9_glob_fix.patch,
    and 025-4.3.9_domxml_segfaults.patch
  * Resolves undiscolsed vulnerabilities in GPC processing and rfc1867
    handling of file uploads via the $_FILES array; these have since
    been assigned CVE CAN-2004-0958 and CAN-2004-0959 (closes: #274206)
  * After some fairly heavy testing from several users and developers,
    finally update php4-snmp to use libsnmp5 (closes: #195929)
  * Add 026-4.3.10_session_fixes.patch from CVS, which prevents PHP
    from segfaulting when a nonexistant or unsupported save_handler or
    serialize_handler is specified in php.ini.
  * Add /etc/apache/conf.d/php4.conf, setting up our mime-types, on the
    off chance that the user's /etc/mime.types is broken (closes: #271171)
  * Reintroduce a CGI binary at /usr/bin/php4-cgi, so people who can't
    make use of the --force-cgi-redirect CGI binary in /usr/lib/cgi-bin
    can instead use #!/usr/bin/php4-cgi scripts (closes: #273143)
  * Enable FastCGI for both CGI binaries, now that it no longer conflicts
    with, but rather complements, the CGI SAPI (closes: #233849)
  * Bump libgd2 build-dep a notch to make sure we build against a version
    that actually has XPM support built in (closes: #270435)
  * Finally drop the bogus libapache-mod-ssl dependency from the apache1.3
    php4 module, as glibc (>= 2.3.2.ds1-17) has fixed the dlopen refcount
    bug that we were hacking around (closes: #205553, #230956, #271000)
  * Remove the mm session handler from the apache1.3 build.  Since the
    files handler now works on all arches, and is configured to be secure
    by default, mm seems to have outlived its usefulness.
    (closes: #119902, #149430, #166811, #272463, #232840)
  * Rename sapi/apache2handler/sapi_apache2.c to mod_php4.c so that
    <IfModule> directives aren't ambiguous between php4 and php5.
  * Add Czech translation, thanks to Miroslav Kure (closes: #274038)
  * Configure CLI with --with-libedit for readline support, and add
    027-readline_is_editline.patch, since Debian's libedit headers are
    not installed in /usr/include/readline (closes: #274031)
  * libcurl grew a new SONAME somewhere along the way, and upgrading
    doesn't seem to cause regressions in php4-curl, so upgrade we shall,
    changing build-deps accordingly (closes: #260389)

    php.ini as a starting reference, so that command line scripts that
    used to work don't start mysteriously failing (closes: #270153)
  * php4-common has grown a postrm script to make sure we completely
    clean out and remove /var/lib/php4 during the purge phase.
  * Optimize garbage collection cronjob to use 'xargs -r -0 rm', so we
    aren't forking for every session file we delete (closes: #268918)

    - Change frequency of session file cleansing, based on the maximum value
      of session.gc_maxlifetime from all php.ini files (closes: #269688).
    - Update README.Debian to mention session cleaning cron job.
  * Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>:
    - Drop php4-cgi from the list of alternate dependencies for the php4
      metpackage to smooth upgrades for woody users who have both php4 and
      php4-cgi installed (closes: #269628, #269348, #269377)
    - Fix cut-n-paste issue in php4-cli postinst (closes: #269466)
    - Add 023-4.3.9_array_fixes.patch, which fixes problems with the
      extract() function misbehaving with multiple element references.
    - Add 024-4.3.9_glob_fix.patch to fix broken return values from glob()
      when it succeeds with no matches (closes: #269287)
    - Add 025-4.3.9_domxml_segfaults.patch, fixing segfaults in the domxml
      extension when it shares memory space with other libxml2-using libs.
    - Update the comments in php.ini to point out that, due to dilinger's
      changes above, session.gc_maxlifetime is honoured by the gc cronjob.

    upload due to the php4-common move from arch:all to arch:any
  * Clean up lintian warnings regarding scripts that weren't executable
    and executables that weren't scripts.
  * Add a lintian override for the non-standard-dir-perm of /var/lib/php4
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.6.1 (no changes, other than the above)

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>  Thu, 26 Aug 2004 21:53:27 -0600

php4 (4:4.3.8-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default session.save_path is now compiled in to php4, allowing
    us to, again, comment out the value in php.ini.
  * Comment out session.gc_probability in the default php.ini, as we've
    now compiled in a default of 0, allowing the cronjob to do the
    garbage collection for us instead. (closes: #267720)
  * Make the 5 SAPI postinsts smarter, allowing them to poke around in
    people's configs and make sure that sessions won't be broken
    after we upgraded them from a perfectly functional system.
  * Add 022-4.3.9_sprintf_fixes.patch, fixing incorrect formatting of
    floats with padding by sprintf().
  * Make php4-common arch:any, and loosen up some of the other any->all
    package dependencies to make sure binNMUs won't break.

php4 (4:4.3.8-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Back out LFS support AGAIN, as we're disabling LFS in apache2 for
    the Sarge release. (closes: #266869)
  * Add 021-4.3.9_sybase_ct_fixes.patch, backporting several fixes
    for the sybase_ct extension from 4.3.9rc1.
  * Tidy up descriptions a fair bit:
    - Disambiguate short descriptions of SAPIs. (closes: #244571)
    - Refresh the (now much longer) lists of built-in modules for each SAPI.
    - Explain why caudium-php4 can't use any loadable extensions.
    - Remove silly advertising blurb for Zend, since very few people are
      still using php3, and those who are can't be convinced to upgrade
      just by telling them "Hey, it's faster!".
    - Add Homepage URI to each SAPI description.
    - Fix typo in php4-domxml description. (closes: #146124)
  * Make caudium-php4 provide php4-mysql and php4-pgsql, so it can be used
    with packages that depend on something like "php4, php4-mysql".
  * Enable --with-mime-magic and make sure all SAPIs depend on libmagic1
    to pull in /usr/share/misc/file/magic.mime (closes: #175136)

  * Add libgcrypt11-dev to the build-depends, as something seems to be
    pulling it in and causing an FTBFS (closes: #265952)
  * Add 020-4.3.9_overflow_fixes, backporting fix for integer overflows
    in array_slice(), array_splice(), substr(), substr_replace(),
    strspn() and strcspn().
  * Bump the apache2 build-dep to (>= 2.0.50-9) to ensure we're building
    against the new ABI-incompatble libapr0, which brings in proper
    large file support.  Bump the apache2 binary dependency as well.
    (closes: #266210, #266192)
  * Enable large file support on all SAPIs except for caudium, as I'm not
    sure how caudium will react to the change, and I don't want to
    destabilise anything just before release.  This change has been
    heavily tested with apache2/apache/cgi/cli, and all is well there.
  * Re-enable 019-z_off_t_as_long.patch, which is needed to make sure
    that LFS-enabled SAPIs can still use zlib file functions correctly.
  * Rework the apache2 restarting logic to only restart apache2 if
    apache2ctl configtest succeeds, otherwise kick out a warning to
    the user.  Even then, we run force-reload with ||true, in case
    apache2 fails to start for other reasons (closes: #264958) 
  * Make php4-gd Provide php4-gd2, so packages which still depend on
    php4-gd2 are installable (and so packaging frontends can take the
    provides/conflicts/replaces hint and DTRT with it)
  * Split php4-cgi to php4-cgi and php4-cli (closes: #227915)
    - Add php4-cli to debian/control, replaces older php4-cgi versions
    - php4-cgi depends on php4-cli for smooth transitions
    - php4-pear now depends on php4-cli (closes: #243214, #221434)
    - Add php4-cli to list of SAPIs configurable for modules
    - Munge php.1 manpage to include -cli info
    - Enable pcntl and ncurses in -cli (closes: #135861, #190947, #241806)
  * Move all of php4's files to libapache-mod-php4, and make php4 a
    metapackage that depends on libapache-mod-php4 | libapache2-mod-php4 |
    php4-cgi | caudium-php4 (closes: #244573, #246654, #244571, #266517)
  * Include skeleton directory in php4-dev (closes: #95832, #211338)
  * Include php.ini-recommended in php4-common's examples (closes: #181396)
  * Move /var/lib/php4 to php4-common and install a cronjob that cleans
    out old sessions every 30 minutes (closes: #256831, #257111)
  * Move the libapache-mod-ssl dependency from php4-imap to
    libapache-mod-php4 to stop irritating users of other SAPIs
    (closes: #240003, #246887, #263381)
  * Compile pgsql and mysql support into the caudium SAPI, so it's
    slightly less useless (closes: #181175)

  * Build-depend on chrpath and use it to nuke rpath from modules
    during the install target of debian/rules.
  * Add 018-unix_socket_fd_leak.patch to get rid of UNIX socket file
    descriptor leak on failed fsockopen() calls. (closes: #257269)
  * It would seem that if we want LFS support, all SAPIs and all extensions
    that do file access need to be built with LFS support, and since
    apache2 currently doesn't have LFS, this presents a problem. As
    such, I'm disabling LFS accross the board until apache2 supports it.
    (closes: #263962)
  * Add 019-z_off_t_as_long.patch, including local headers for zlib,
    forcing off_t = long for gzip file functions, however disable it
    for now, as we'll only need it if we reenable LFS (closes: #208608)
  * Add the Debian package revision as EXTRAVERSION to PHP, so one can
    more easily tell what version is currently running (for instance,
    if a user fails to restart Apache after an upgrade of php4, this
    would become obvious to them in the version banner and in phpinfo()
  * Fixed up debian/patches, adjusting offsets and adding newlines,
    so patch stops complaining and applies them cleanly.
  * libapache2-mod-php4 postinst now forces a reload of apache2, which
    should get the module properly working in all cases where people
    previously thought 'apachectl graceful' would cut it.
    (closes: #241352, #263424, #228343)
  * debian/rules explicitly sets PROG_SENDMAIL during configure so
    that builds on buildds with no sendmail installed don't get the
    mail() function disabled. (closes: #180734)
  * Enable XMLRPC-EPI support for all SAPIs (closes: #228825, #249368)
  * Enable sysvmsg support for all SAPIs (closes: #236190)
  * Enable dbx support for all SAPIs (closes: #229508, #249797)
  * Nuke aclocal.m4 before we run ./buildconf to ensure we get it
    regenerated correctly, and we get an up-to-date libtoolization.

  * Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net>:
    - Added a debian/watch file for the curious, or people running
      automated uscan scripts over the entire archive.
    - Bump libgd2 build-dep to 2.0.28 to buy us guaranteed GIF
      support in php4-gd (closes: #66293)
    - Add 015-gdNewDynamicCtx_Add_Ex.patch, which fixes three double-free
      errors in php4-gd.  This, in concert with the librrd0 update
      (see #261323) should clear up all known segfaults in php4-gd
      (closes: #220196, #234571, #241270, #246833, #251220, #260790)
      Thanks to Klaus Reimer <k@ailis.de> for the tip.
    - Add 016-pread_pwrite_XOPEN_SOURCE_500.patch, which fixes use of
      pread/pwrite in conjunction with LFS64.  This should fix the files
      session handler on sparc, as well as the amd64 build failure.
      (closes: #234766, #239420, #261311, #248765)
    - Clean up debian/rules to remove a bunch of obsolete cruft, as well
      as introducing an LFSFLAGS, allowing us to easily turn LFS support
      on and off for each SAPI.
    - Re-enable LFS for apache 1.3, as it was enable in Woody and we should
      remain backward compatible.

      in debian/rules.  Not sure how this was missed for so long.
    - Add 014-apache2handler_CVS_fixes.patch, which fixes a memory
      leak in the apache2handler SAPI, as well as a logical mishandling
      of fatal errors during activation.

  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
    - Revert large file support, which appears to cause

      + Improved stability during startup when memory_limit is used.
      + Replace alloca() with emalloc() for better stack protection.
      + Added missing safe_mode checks inside ftok and itpc.
      + Fixed address allocation routine in IMAP extension.
      + Prevent open_basedir bypass via MySQL's LOAD DATA LOCAL.
      + Fixes DoS in readfile() function, see CAN-2005-0596.

      008-xbithack.patch
      011-curl_api_update.patch
      012-curl_deprecated_opts.patch.
    - Add 013-force_getaddrinfo.patch, so that getaddrinfo support is
      always enabled (instead of doing check during build).

  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
    - Enumerate supported SAPIs in both the module postinst and the module
      config script, to avoid "question not found" errors from debconf.
      This doesn't give us automatic support for new SAPIs as they're
      added, but it avoids trying to configure SAPIs that we don't support
      (e.g., caudium), and it also sidesteps shell syntax errors caused by
      strangely-named subdirectories.
    - Remove apache2 from the TODO list, because it's done
      (closes: #243793).
    - Add /var/lib/php4 to the list of directories for the apache2 module,
      so we don't end up with a missing session dir (closes: #240962).
    - s/modules-config/apache-modconf/, now that the canonical name of the
      apache-common tool has changed
    - Drop references to php3 in README.Debian, and document the
      simplified process for enabling php4 in apache 1.3 (closes: #244564).

php4 (4:4.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Update local patch set accordingly, with help
    from Andres Salomon <dilinger@voxel.net>.
    - includes fix for snmpget() not closing its socket
      (closes: #207363).
  * Update build-depends to libdb4.2-dev, to match apache-dev
    (closes: #231692).
  * Drop translations of stale templates, and add new German debconf
    translation; thanks to Alwin Meschede <ameschede@gmx.de>
    (closes: #232270).
  * Add new Danish debconf translation; thanks to Claus Hindsgaul
    <claus_h@image.dk> (closes: #233887).
  * Move local patches into debian/patches/ for easier management, and
    add debian/rules targets for build-time application of patches.
  * Fix a problem with PHP "xbithack" causing ini scope leakage
    (closes: #230047).
  * Re-enable the openssl extension statically, since we now know for
    sure that the php4-imap problems are a glibc bug (closes: #197450).
  * Fix pear to set /usr/bin/php4 instead of /usr/bin/php for the value
    of php_bin, so PEAR-managed scripts work correctly
    (closes: #228381).  In addition, use alternatives for /usr/bin/php
    for the benefit of user scripts (closes: #185283).
  * Set the default session save_path to /var/lib/php4 instead of to
    /tmp, and create this directory such that all users (for php4-cgi)
    can create files there and access their own files once created, but
    not see the names of other files in the directory (closes: #139810).
  * Drop our override of upstream's register_globals default
    (closes: #230878).

  * Also recompiled against the new version of libc-client (closes: #227347).
  * Fix pear to not expect to be able to twiddle locks when running as
    non-root, which also seems to fix a memory utilization problem
    (closes: #225026).
  * Make php4-imap depend on libapache-mod-ssl, since this seems to be
    the only reliable way of getting apache to stop segfaulting.
  * Build-depend on libt1-dev, which replaces t1lib-dev.

php4 (4:4.3.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix prerm script to remove mod_php4, *not* mod_perl, from the
    config (Closes: #216889).
  * Use /etc/$i/httpd.conf instead of /etc/$i to decide whether to
    call modules-config.
  * Don't invoke debconf unless we have to in the postinst, to reduce
    the risk of interactions between modules-config and our questions.
  * Add Dutch debconf translation; thanks to Tim Dijkstra
    <tim@famdijkstra.org> (closes: #221439).
  * Sync dba lock handling against upstream CVS HEAD, to fix a bug with
    truncating db4 files when opening with 'c' (create).

php4 (4:4.3.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

php4 (4:4.3.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't call db_stop in the postinst, as this seems to cause problems
    for modules-config (closes: #215663, #215584).
  * Remove duplicate -prefer-pic flag on caudium build, in hope of
    making libtool do something sensible on ia64,hppa (closes: #216020).
  * Always build with debugging symbols, per current policy.
  * Unconditionally call dh_strip, which knows about DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS;
    and call install -s when installing shared extensions by hand.
  * Fix upstream build rules to not call libtool --silent.

    modules-config interface.

  * Kill the lintian warning on the grammar in the copyright file.
  * Redirect apacheconfig I/O to /dev/tty, to work around debconf
    behavior (for real this time).  Closes: #207468, #206404.
  * Replace 'zendapi' with 'phpapi', since the former does not
    accurately describe the ABI changes that affect modules and can
    leave some packages installable but broken (closes: #208020).  Also,
    remove the versioned conflicts with php4-{mysql,pgsql}, since this
    now supersedes.
  * Add French debconf translation; thanks to Michel Grentzinger
    <mic.grentz@online.fr> (closes: #207662).

    with autoconf (closes: #180497).
  * Conflict with old php4-pgsql as we do with php4-mysql, as it
    manifests the same bug.
  * Add preliminary rules for building apache2 SAPI, but don't enable.
  * Call db_stop before trying to run apacheconfig (closes: #206404).
  * Check for the existence of /etc/php4 before trying to rmdir it,

    (closes: #175836).

  * Kludge the caudium sapi, by hard-coding the include path we need for

    Someone remember to remove this later when the bug is fixed. :)

php4 (4:4.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "When is Debian going to have new software like XF^H^HPHP 4.2?" release.
  * Probably the last update (barring huge packaging bugs or plain broken
    binaries) before starting on a complete reorg of the PHP packages.
  * Deserializer now works on big-endian architectures (addresses bug #121391
    and probably others)
  * This release probably fixes a whole bunch of bugs.  Will be going through
    the bug list and playing the reproducibility game after the upload.
  * Default include_path in php.ini now set to include pear.
  * Upstream default for register_globals HAS CHANGED.  In the Debian php.ini
    we are still using "register_globals = On" for compatibility reasons,
    however our packages will change too.  This is a warning for anyone
    packaging PHP scripts and applications to make sure you'll be compatible

    - Added a note to README.Debian about the unserializer (and sessions)
